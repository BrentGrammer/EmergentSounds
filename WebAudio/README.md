# Using the Web Audio API

Built with vite and React.

### Prerequisites

## Running

- `cd WebAudio` (make sure you are in the project folder)
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## Experiment Suggestions

- Destructive Interference: When two waves are superimposed and their crests and troughs align, they cancel each other out.
  - Setting the Gain on one sound wave to the negative inversion of the gain on another sound wave will cancel them out.
  - Gain is the absolute value of multiplied volume, but a negative value changes the phase from a positive value.
    - -2 multiplies the volume by 2, but it is an opposite phase from a sound with a gain of +2.
